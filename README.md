# Baleon - A new Roguelike with NCurses

![](https://github.com/jordansavant/baleon.c/raw/master/Baleon-Action.gif)

## Building

Ensure you have:
- gcc
- make
- libncurses-dev

Build and Run:
- make run

*Note* I used the gcc extension for nested C functions to implement closure like behavior that makes the compiled binaries have executable stacks
