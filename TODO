CORE MECHANIC:
- subdue enemies and choose to absorb their essence
	- grants "aberrations" that produce strengths and weaknesses
	- abberations come from enemies killed, can they come from objects in the world?
- why this may be fun?
	- mystery of aberrations
	- cocktail of how they react
	- with many aberrations comes highly unique combinations of characters


monster->attack_method = melee();
monster->attack_method = spell();
