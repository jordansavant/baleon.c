CORE MECHANIC:
- subdue enemies and choose to absorb their essence
	- grants "aberrations" that produce strengths and weaknesses
	- abberations come from enemies killed, can they come from objects in the world?
- why this may be fun?
	- mystery of aberrations
	- cocktail of how they react
	- with many aberrations comes highly unique combinations of characters




TODO:
- cursor defines context of interactions
	- if cursor on mob
		- we can inspect them
	- if cursor on living, adjacent mob
		- we can have inputs to melee them
	- if cursor on living, distant visible enemy
		- we can have inputs to range them
- OR we can enter contexts based on inputs (THIS)
	- targeting modes: self, melee, ranged los, ranged teleport, ranged los aoe, ranged teleport aoe
	- if we press melee input we go into melee targeting mode
		- this could highlight melee range?
		- press melee again (or activate) will attack melee on cursor (if not in melee then pull vector?)
	- if we press ranged input we go into ranged targeting mode
		- draws line to cursor
		- press ranged again (or activate) it launches ranged attack along path (can be blocked by other things?)
	- if we press inventory we get list of items
		- items have targeting modes
		- selecting item activates related targeting mode
		- activating in that mode activates that item for that target location
		- ?equipped melee/equipped ranged are just more items being activated?
		- ?spells in spell book are just items as well?
		- ?maybe an item has an "activateable"? spells have activateables? powers have an activateable?
	- TODO
		- FSM targeting modes
			- y = equipped weapon targeting mode (if self it applies immediately)
			- i = inventory panel, items listed with shortcut keys
				- locks out movement inputs
				- pressing button runs targeting mode (if self it applies immediately)
				- [esc] escapes that mode
			- j = magic panel, spells listed with shortcut keys
				- see inventory FSM
- ui:
	- mob panel
		- lists visible mobs and things
		- their timers? health?
		- we are a mob?
	- interrupt event panel
		- appears when events occur
		- used for deeper inspection?
	- character panel
		- active timers (effects) (brogue)
			- health
			- exp?
		- stats (defense?)
	- inventory panel?
- attack mob: ranged
- multi map w/ transition
- port xogeni parts


FEATURE CREEP
- ui reloader when terminal fucks up
- input recorder?
- how do we get mouse cursor? (do we need this)
	- see mspy.c for example code
	- we got pads to render the complete map, but now how do we translate cursor to pad?



BROGUE NOTES

- menu items highlight their activate letter
- hovering over equipment opens context menu
- mouse hover on tiles
- mouse click to autowalk, pathfind highlight
- mouse hover short description

- tileset is dark bgs
- map is self contained, small, explorable, not scrollable?
- in game list of visible items and enemies with their sprite
- small log at the top? contextable?

- holes you can fall through!
- "search" area command
- rest command
- explore command
- ranged attack show bresenham path
    - missed attacks can be picked back up

Whats the allure? the loop?

    - changes coloring
    - makes things that are there appear randomly
    - make other things appear taht are not
