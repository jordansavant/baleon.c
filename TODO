ABERRATION IDEAS
- unlock aberation ability at first levels

	- enemy difficulties and flavors for aberation lists?
- press your luck game begins
	- you receive a random positive or negative condition
	- you can continue to mutate up to X number of times
	- each time adds another aberration effect
negatives:

- throw distance is 2
- randomly lose an inventory item
- forget portions of the dungeon randomly
- cannot heal from alchemy
- water is toxic
- double negatives of effect A
- cannot fly
- cannot range attack less than 5
positives:
- increased vision

- heal X more per turn
- effect A invulnerable
- increased inventory size
- can throw melee weapons
- randomly (automatically) find a dungeon key

CORE MECHANIC:
- subdue enemies and choose to absorb their essence
	- grants "aberrations" that produce strengths and weaknesses
	- abberations come from enemies killed, can they come from objects in the world?
- why this may be fun?
	- mystery of aberrations
	- cocktail of how they react
	- with many aberrations comes highly unique combinations of characters
